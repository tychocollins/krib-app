To make a GitHub README look great, you need to use **Markdown syntax** specifically. If you just paste plain text, GitHub won't know how to format it with bold titles, tables, or code boxes.

Here is the "Correct" version. You can copy this entire block and paste it directly into your `README.md` file on GitHub or in Antigravity.
